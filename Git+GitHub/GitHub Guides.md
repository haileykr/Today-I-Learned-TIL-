# GitHub Guides
### (1) Hello World
<p>: What is GitHub? / Create a Repository / Create a Branch / Make a Commit / Open a Pull Request / Merge Pull Request
: **Repository** - usually used to organize a single project! Can contain folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets, data sets, etc [anything your project needs].
: **Branching** - is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
: **Commit** - saved changes
: **Pull Requests** - proposing your changes and asking that someone will review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
</p>

### (2) Understanding the GitHub Flow
<p>**a. Create a Branch**
: Main is Main.
: A branch name should be descriptive

**b. Add commits**
: "Commit" messages have to be clear!

**c. Open a Pull Request**
: at any required phase of the development
: @"mention" system
: Pull requests initiate discussion on your commit
: Useful for Open Source Projects
     -> if using **Fork & Pull Model**...
         : provides a way to notify project maintainers about the changes you'd like them to consider
     -> if using **Shared Repository Model**...
         : helps start a code review & conversation on proposed changes before they are merged into the main

**d. Discuss and Review your code**
: You can continue to push to incorporate your feedback to the reviewers' comments.
: Pull Request comments are written in Markdown (ex. embedding images & emojis, using pre-formmated texts, and other lightweight formatting easier)

**e. Deploy**
: You can deploy from a branch for final testing in production before merging to main.

**f. Merge**
: After the changes are verified in production, they can be merged to the main branch.
: Pull Requests keep a record of the historical changes
: Incorporate certain keywords are relevant
</p>

### (3) Forking Projects
: **Fork** - Process of contributing to someone else's project or using someone else's project as the starting point of your own
: **"Creating a fork"** - making a personal copy of someone else's project
: **Clone / Download** - to actually work on it. Clone with the command line or using GitHub Desktop.
: Make changes, then Stage, Commit, & Push.
: Pull Request!
