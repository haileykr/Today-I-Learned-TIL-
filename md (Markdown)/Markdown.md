### Definition

> Markdown is **a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax**, created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz.  
> Markdown is **often used** for formatting _readme files,_ for _writing messages in online discussion forums_, and to _create rich text using a plain text editor_.
> 
> -   Wikipedia

The extension of Markdown files is **_.md_**.

### History

> Swartz and John Gruber then worked together to create the Markdown language in 2004, with the goal of enabling people **"to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)" - through a Perl script (Markdown.pl).**.

> Its key design goal is **_readability_** â€“ that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions, unlike text formatted with a markup language, such as Rich Text Format (RTF) or HTML, which have obvious tags and formatting instructions. To this end, its main inspiration is the existing conventions for marking up plain text in email, though it also draws from earlier markup languages, notably setext, Textile, and reStructuredText.

### Standardization

**_CommonMark_**  
: 2012, to **"document various tools and resources available to document authors and developers, as well as implementors of the various markdown implementations"**
